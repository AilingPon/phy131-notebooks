# phy131-notebooks
Notebooks available for the PHY 131 Practicals.

Notebooks are sorted by Practical, and have an option to use a script or a Notebook.

If you are using Google Colaboratory or Jupyter Notebook, you will want to use a Notebook.

If you are running the scripts from the command line, you will want to use a script. 

A notebook is recommended. 

See the Python installation instructions if you would like a local copy of Python.
